    "# Tokenization and Word Counts\n",
    "\n",
    "Word tokenization and counts are basic components of text analysis. You've likely seen word clouds that visualize the most common words in a corpus or document. Common words, it's reasonably argued, are significant indications that reflect the core ideas or themes about language.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces some of these basic functions. We'll use the library, scikit-learn (sklearn), which offers many functions that can be used for machine learning and text analysis. We'll also change the shape of matrices and dataframes so that we can work across different structures of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "1. Introduce sklearn for word counts.\n",
    "2. Reshape data from matrices (wide-format) to dataframes (long-format) in order to rejoin data and metadata\n",
    "3. Adjust visualizations to better convey information"

    "\n",
    "Keeping or removing stop words is an interpretive choice that has repercussions in text analysis. There are reasons to keep them and reasons to remove them. Stop words, for example, can be useful for authorship attribution (determining who wrote a document). You might experiment with using stop words down the road and see if and how the results change.\n",

    "The min_df argument ignores words that appear infrequently. In our case, we're using a float number (0.05), which is a fraction (5%) of the dataset. An integer would indicate an absolute count. Together with stop_words, we're reducing the amount of data we're working with.\n",

    "A pandas dataframe has an index to maintain relational data. Relational data, here, refers to how we read a table. When we read a dataframe, we understand that a row and column share a relationship. In our dataset, we use a row to describe a single document. A column, on the other, indicates a specific value. In other words, we read dataframes horizontally and vertically, but never diagonally.\n",

Rather than hand-typing each word from the dataset into a column, we can retrieve unique words from the count_vec we created earlier. count_vec stores every unique word within a corpus. We can retrieve these words with the function .get_feature_names() that comes with sklearn's CountVectorizer.\n",

    "\n",
    "As we can see, word tokenization and counts start to show the differences in language between real and fake news. But, word counts use raw numbers (whole integers) which introduces certain problems. Longer texts that re-use the same word will inflate the significance of that word. The language in shorter documents, on the other hand, will be underrepresented. Ultimately, word counts are not the most nuanced way to represent language computationally.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebook, we'll introduce a very common and more reliable method to account for word frequencies and their relationships to document length. This notebook, though, hopefully helps to some of the more basic functions of text analysis that you can call on in later work."
